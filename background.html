<h1>Project Summmary</h1>

<p class="one">The project will target 70 people, more is accepted as well. The total budget of the project is 25,000 and 20% of the budget will be contributed by the community.
The project was started to support our focused issue with our Partner Institution. One of the top most problems affecting the community is the unstable/broken down property and
 visible unsanitary restrooms.Employees/workers and residents are uncomfortable with the idea of having to use a room that is made for comfort to be unsanitary and unsafe for 
 health. The other obvious challenge is that it may disrupt their work flow and may lead to some leaving the Institution.

<img class="five" src="one.jpg">
<p class="four">This project is very important because the people in The Badjao Community and our Partner Institution do not have a proper sanitary area where they can do their own private business.
 They also don’t have enough funds to have this built, so we are pushing this project to help them gain funds and be able to rebuild their unstable restrooms, as well as be able to
 provide supplies to help clean up. They have a community filled with families and children who don't have the knowledge of proper sanitary practices.<br><br>This project is very important because the people in The Badjao Community and our Partner Institution do not have a proper sanitary area where they can do their own private business.
 They also don’t have enough funds to have this built, so we are pushing this project to help them gain funds and be able to rebuild their unstable restrooms, as well as be able to
 provide supplies to help clean up. They have a community filled with families and children who don't have the knowledge of proper sanitary practices. This project will teach them
 how to clean up environments and themselves properly after using the comfort room and how to maintain the cleanliness, to be able to prevent bacteria and germs that can cause
 illnesses. This project will further explain to the people of this community the importance of having clean sanitation areas to their overall health as poor sanitation will lead 
 to diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid, intestinal worm infections and polio. The collected funds from donors and activities are then to be used for the construction
 of sanitary areas and sanitary materials for everyone.
