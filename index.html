			<p>What is the current Issue in the community?<br></br>
			The Issue in both communities (Badjao Community and The Partner Institution) that we chose to focus and discuss about is the lack of funding and the damaged properties in the workplace. This is an important matter to help resolve to keep residents and workers safe and sanitized, since the cause of the said damaged property/ies is the lack of care and abandonment due to the pandemic.<br><br> Now that employees are back and ready to help the Badjao Community, they face the problem of unsafe work environment. Health issues may rise, accidents/injuries or sickness may be caught to the residents affecting their work ethic. This may discourage the Institution and discontinue their partnership with the Badjao Community and their issues.

			<b><p>HISTORY</b><br>
			The Badjao people are an ethnic group that has been in The Philippines for at least 500 AD. Pastor Felicisimo "Jun" Morales provided for the community. For more than 8 years, Pastor Jun and his wife resided at Isla Verde with the Badjao. The group was founded with the intention of setting an example for the badjao community's residents. At first, the organization had about 35 households. Now, the community in Matina Aplaya has more than 500 people. However, one of their social concerns is that they suffer from extreme poverty. The government should step up efforts to protect the rights to livelihood, shelter, and health for the Badjao community.
