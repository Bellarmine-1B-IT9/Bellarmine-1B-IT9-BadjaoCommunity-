<h1>Background Significance of the study</h1>
<p class="two">The value of composting to the community and the environment is that it can fix many environmental issues in our surrounding area. Composting enriches soil and suppresses plant diseases and pests, keeping it healthy for us to consume. Therefore proving its importance/value in its existence. One of the many issues in the Badjao Community is the lack of planted fruits and vegetables that are healthy/clean enough to consume or sell. The community can benefit from composting for better results and a healthier/stable environment plus lifestyle.</p><br><br>

<h1>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h1>
<p class="two">If the eggshell compost is added to the environment's soil, what are the results/rate of growth   in the environment?</p><br><br>
<h1>HYPOTHESIS</h1>

<p class="two">If the eggshell compost mixture is added to the soil, then the rate of growth of the alfalfa plant will be faster.</p><br><br>

<h1>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</h1>
<p class="two">Since our current focus is the effect of composting, we decided to go with eggshell compost. From our understanding and deep research about the application/use of the compost, we found out that by adding eggshells to soil is beneficial especially towards our set-ups (The Alfalfa plant or Medicago Sativa), they are a rich source of calcium and other essential nutrients that a plant needs. By understanding the transfer of nutrients from the compost to the plant we were able to properly define and state the problem and hypothesis for our experiment.</p>
